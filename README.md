# Quiz Me

Quiz Me is a general knowledge quiz website designed for users to put their knowlege to the test. Each day a new set of questions will be released. Users will be able to share their score with friends and family. There will also be a running score page with the top 100 players listed within the last 30 days.

## Existing Features:
---

## Welcome pop-up page:
-  This is a landing page to welcome the user to the website. The welcome page will also serve the purpose of giving the user an overview of how to use the application.

## Question game play area:
- This is the section of the game. Each question will be displayed here one at a time and the user will need to select an answer (either option A, B, C or D) before they are able to click the 'next' button to move on to the next question.

## Features Left To Implement:
- In the future, I would like to implement a score board showing the top players within a time period (eg. top scoring players within the last 30 days). Each player would have their profile scored daily based on their totals within the score time frame.

- Another feature that I'd like to implement going forward would be a way for the user to share their score. This would be via Social Media channels & email.

## Testing:

- Media queries have been added for small screen sizes. This means that the website should be easily readable and functional across a wide range of devices. The overall design was completed on a desktop size screen (large), therefore the website design and media queries should cover all standard screen size widths and orientations.

- I checked to see if media queries are required for medium size screens. However all functionality and design looked to be working and displayed correctly n medium size screens. Therefore no media queries have been added for these screen sizes.

- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Saari.

- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

- I confirmed that the welcome pop up page, logo, help pop up page, game area and end-game page are all readable and easy to understand.


### Validator Testing:
- HTML:
    Upon my initial testing using the W3C validator, I found an error where I forgot to add an 'alt' attribute to one of my images added to the website.

    I corrected this issue and ran the validator check once more. The report showed no more issues.

    

- CSS:
    No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C CSS Validator (Jigsaw)
