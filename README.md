# Quiz Me

Quiz Me is a general knowledge quiz website designed for users to put their knowlege to the test. Each day a new set of questions will be released. Users will be able to share their score with friends and family. There will also be a running score page with the top 100 players listed within the last 30 days.

## Existing Features:

## Welcome pop-up page:
-  This is a landing page to welcome the user to the website. The welcome page will also serve the purpose of giving the user an overview of how to use the application.

## Features Left To Implement:
- In the future, I would like to implement a score board showing the top players within a time period (eg. top scoring players within the last 30 days). Each player would have their profile scored daily based on their totals within the score time frame.

- Another feature that I'd like to implement going forward would be a way for the user to share their score. This would be via Social Media channels & email.

## Testing:

- Media queries have been added for small and medium screen sizes. This means that the website should be easily readable and functional across a wide range of devices. The overall design was completed on a desktop size screen (large), therefore the website design and media queries should cover all standard screen size widths and orientations.

- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Saari.

- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

- I confirmed that the navigation, header, pricing page, gallery and contact us page are all readable and easy to understand.

- I have confirmed that the form works. Required fields have been added to essential information needed to contact the customer. A valid email address only works in the email address field. The submit button works and takes the user to a seperate thank you page.

### Validator Testing:
- HTML:
    No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

- CSS:
