### Features Left To Implement:
- In the future, we could look at adding an automatic online booking system that would allow users to make bookings using the website.

-------

## Testing:

- Media queries have been added for small and medium screen sizes. This means that the website should be easily readable and functional across a wide range of devices. The overall design was completed on a desktop size screen (large), therefore the website design and media queries should cover all standard screen size widths and orientations.

- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Saari.

- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

- I confirmed that the navigation, header, pricing page, gallery and contact us page are all readable and easy to understand.

- I have confirmed that the form works. Required fields have been added to essential information needed to contact the customer. A valid email address only works in the email address field. The submit button works and takes the user to a seperate thank you page.

### Validator Testing:
- HTML:
    No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

- CSS:
    No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C CSS Validator (Jigsaw)
